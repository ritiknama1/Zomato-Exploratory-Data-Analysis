# Zomato Restaurant Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project analyzes restaurant data from Zomato to uncover insights into customer preferences and restaurant performance. The goal is to identify areas of potential growth, such as expanding online ordering, and to understand the relationship between pricing, ratings, and popularity.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Univariate Analysis

- **Online Ordering**: Explored the percentage of restaurants offering online ordering.
- **Table Booking**: Investigated the availability of table booking across restaurants.
- **Ratings Distribution**: Analyzed the distribution of restaurant ratings.
- **Cost Analysis**: Examined the range of costs for two people across different restaurants.

### Bivariate Analysis

- **Ratings vs. Cost**: Analyzed the relationship between restaurant ratings and the cost for two people.
- **Votes vs. Type of Restaurant**: Examined how different types of restaurants (e.g., Dining, Cafes) perform in terms of customer votes.
- **Online Ordering vs. Ratings**: Investigated whether restaurants offering online ordering have higher or lower ratings.

## Key Insights

1. **Online Ordering Opportunity**: Many restaurants do not offer online ordering, representing a potential area for growth.
2. **Casual Dining Focus**: The majority of restaurants do not offer table booking, suggesting a focus on casual dining experiences.
3. **Popularity of Dining**: Dining out is the most popular restaurant experience, with the highest customer engagement.
4. **Quality Perception**: Higher-priced restaurants tend to have better ratings, indicating a potential perception of price equating to quality.
5. **Votes as a Popularity Metric**: The number of votes a restaurant receives strongly indicates its popularity.
6. **Innovation Potential**: There is an opportunity to introduce new features, such as combining online ordering with table booking, to enhance customer experience and improve analysis granularity.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights key areas for business development, such as expanding online ordering options and understanding customer perceptions related to price and quality. By focusing on these areas, restaurants can better align with customer expectations and improve their overall performance.

## Business Case Study Solved

Through this analysis, the project aimed to solve the following business questions:

1. What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2. How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3. What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4. What is the average spending of couples who order food online?
5. Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
6. Which type of restaurant received more offline orders?

These insights provide a strong foundation for making data-driven decisions in restaurant management and marketing.
